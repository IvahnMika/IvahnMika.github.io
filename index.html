                My name is Ivahn Mika F. Lobrio. I am currently a student of the Bachelor of Science Computer Science course, 1st Year, under the section SBCS-1A. I am currently nineteen years old and was born on September 11, 2004.
                I studied from Kinder from Grade 2 at a school called Rosa L. Susano Novaliches Elementary School, then transferred to study my other elementary grades in Cubao, at Cubao Elementary School. After I graduated as the Top 4 of my class in elementary, I went on to take entrance exams from schools that I am interested in studying at for my high school. This includes schools such as the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, Ramon Magsaysay (Cubao) High School, and even the Philippine Science High School, of which I somehow passed.  I decided to study at RMCHS due to it being the closest to us, while still providing a quality education through its Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics strand.
                My Junior High School days had been rough as far I can remember. I struggled to finish and pass some of my assignments in some classes due to my lack of proper planning and general lack of skills, but I still somehow managed to get through all of my Junior High School years without problem, at least until the pandemic went and struck the Philippines.
                As the pandemic started, us former Grade 10 students were automatically moved to the next grade. This means that some of us can and will study for our Senior High School at a different school. I was one of these students, and this is where my problems regarding school began to exacerbate. This is when online classes became the norm for classing and meeting, and with my lack of social skills, my lack of alertness regarding tasks and how to do them properly finally caught up with me, causing me to repeat 12th Grade.
                I repeated my 12th grade schooling in another school called Quezon City High School. With me reflecting on my past mistakes coupled with the fact that face-to-face classes began to become being a viable method of meeting once again, I managed to graduate as an honor student and as top of my class in School Year 2022-2023.
                With the conclusion of my high school years comes the question “Where would I study for college now?”. For where I would enroll to further my studies, I initially only had one option: to go back to study at PUP. However, talk about the Quezon City University began to pop up among my fellow classmates and colleagues. This is my introduction to Quezon City University and through my classmates. I managed to participate in taking the entrance examinations for the Academic Year 2023-2024. Thankfully, I passed the preliminaries and became able to be part of QCU’s student body, as I was unable to go back to my former school.
                Now as part of the new course BSCS and its only section so far, I am hoping to have a wonderful time with my classmates, my studies, and teachers during my stay here at QCU. I am looking forward to as what’s to come for me in my college days!
